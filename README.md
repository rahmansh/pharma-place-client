# React + Express Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate project for setting up a React and Express.js application using **Vite**.

## Folder Structure

This project is organized into the following main directories:


- **`assets/`**: Contains static files like images, fonts, and other media used throughout the app.
  - Example files: `logo.png`, `background.jpg`, `font.woff`

- **`components/`**: Contains reusable UI components.
  - Example files: `Button.jsx`, `Header.jsx`, `Footer.jsx`
  - Components are the building blocks of the UI and can be reused across different pages.

- **`context/`**: Holds context providers that manage and share state throughout the app.
  - Example files: `AuthContext.js`, `ThemeContext.js`
  - These files allow for global state management using React Context.

- **`firebase/`**: Contains Firebase-related configuration and utilities.
  - Example files: `firebaseConfig.js`, `firebaseUtils.js`
  - This folder is where you handle Firebase initialization and authentication methods.

- **`hooks/`**: Contains custom React hooks.
  - Example files: `useAuth.js`, `useFetch.js`
  - Custom hooks help organize logic that can be reused across components.

- **`layouts/`**: Contains layout components that define the overall structure of the pages.
  - Example files: `MainLayout.jsx`, `AuthLayout.jsx`
  - Layouts are typically used to structure pages by including common elements like headers, footers, sidebars, etc.

- **`pages/`**: Contains components that represent entire pages. These components are usually tied to specific routes.
  - Example files: `HomePage.jsx`, `AboutPage.jsx`, `LoginPage.jsx`
  - Each file corresponds to a specific route in the app.

- **`routes/`**: Defines all the routes of the application.
  - Example files: `AppRoutes.jsx`, `PrivateRoutes.jsx`
  - This folder is used to manage the route logic of the app and ensure the right pages are loaded based on the URL.

- **`styles/`**: Contains all the stylesheets for the app.
  - Example files: `main.css`, `App.css`, `theme.css`
  - This folder is used to manage your global CSS styles and custom themes.
